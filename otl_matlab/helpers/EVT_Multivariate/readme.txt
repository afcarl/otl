This set of Matlab scripts implements the various multivariate extensions to extreme value theory that we have published.  Simply run "Plot_GaussianDensities.m" to regenerate all of the figures from [1].  The commentary in the scripts provides pointers, with reference to the journal article; please feel free to contact the authors for more information [2].
